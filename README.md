# Courtroom
Courtroom puts you in the roles of either a judge, prosecutor, defendant, or witness in an Entirely Virtual courtroom that allows you to act out and roleplay your wildest dreams of incriminating people and arguing over pointless things. You remember Case Caf√©, right? Yeah, it's like that. It's like those Ace Attorney videos where Phoenix and some other dude debate some really specific topic but REAL, and now you can be a part of it.
